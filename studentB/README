Snake README

Overview:
    My Snake app has a snake that moves across a grid of squares and changes
    directions via the arrow keys (up/down/left/right). The goal is for the
    snake to eat food, represented by circles, from the squares. When the
    snake eats a food, the snake grows one square in length and another food
    is spawned in a random location on the board. The game ends when the snake
    moves into itself or moves off screen.

Design Choices:
    direction enum
    tile contents enum
    snake wrapper
    picnictile wrapper
